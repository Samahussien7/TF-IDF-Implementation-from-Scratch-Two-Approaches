# TF-IDF-Implementation-from-Scratch-Two-Approaches
This project provides implementations of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm from scratch in Python, showcasing two distinct approaches for calculating TF-IDF scores. TF-IDF is a fundamental technique in information retrieval and text mining used to evaluate the importance of terms in a document collection.
